And now heading to the most interesting part – painting! Let’s say I want to paint with a purple color. I choose it with mouse-clicking, navigate through my grid and select the pixel I want to be painted in my color. Selected pixel will be highlighted.

Also you will get a message on the upper middle, telling you x and y coordinates of the pixel.

Press confirm and here you go! The pixel you selected is now purple.

There is also a 20 seconds timer, so the game is kind of competitive 😊
